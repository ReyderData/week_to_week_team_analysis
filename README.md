# week_to_week_team_analysis
Analysing a football team season performance on a matchweek basis.

In this python project, I focus on analysing a football team performance on a week to week basis, to see how they perform along the season and comopare it to previous seasons.

All the data is collected from Sofascore https://www.sofascore.com/en-us/ and Fotmob https://www.fotmob.com/en-GB.

After scraping the data I need, I create dataframes, and clean the data to adapt it to my purposes for this project.
With the creation of a couple functions I automatize both processes and make the task easier.

The plots are created with matplotlib and seaborn 

In the .py file I used a function to create an interactive legend in the graph and be able to show/hide the different lineplots.
This feature is thanks to Liam Whyte, Football Data & Performance Analyst, who give me the tip on how to implement it.


This structure is easy to reuse with other teams and competitions and display not only a team performance in different seasons but also different teams in the same comp.
The next improvement will be a function to automate the scraping and create the dfs of all teams for a desired competition and season.

I will post this and analyse the current situation of Real Zaragoza in my Bluesky account: https://bsky.app/profile/reyderdata.bsky.social

Any feedback and tip will be highly appreciated!
